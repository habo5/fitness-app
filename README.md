 A food database has been integrated into the app using the USDA Food Database.An  API has been developed to extract food items and their nutritional information, then a separate, cleaned SQLite database is created. The function that queries this database is stored as an RDS file, which is accessed reactively within the app. Users can enter a food name to retrieve detailed nutritional information for each food item consumed throughout the day.
By entering user information such as age, sex, height, current weight, and goal, the app provides personalized health recommendations related to diet and daily activities. Additionally, it includes a progress tracking feature, allowing users to log their weight and daily calorie intake to monitor their progress over time.
